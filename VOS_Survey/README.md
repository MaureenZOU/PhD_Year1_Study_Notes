# Video Object Segmentation Survey

### So Interesting !!!!
#### Spatial Transformer Network (\[Paper\])[https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5854-spatial-transformer-networks.pdf] (\[Code\])[https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/spatial_transformer_tutorial.html]
```
Summary: This paper propose a generic network module to shift, rotate and rescale the image according to coordinate transformation.
```
```
Comment: It is the best kind of research, apply very light but mathematical things to deep learning and make it a differenciable module. Good performance. 
```

### Reasonable Paper

### Anyway, they are boring papers to read
