### Saving and loading Models [\[link\]](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html)
#### Main related function

```python
torch.save
torch.load
torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict
```

##### state_dict
All the model is inherited from ```torch.nn.Module```, and the model weights could be accessed through ```model.parameters()```. A state_dict is simply a Python dictionary object that maps each layer to its parameter tensor. Optimizer objects ```torch.optim``` also have a state_dict, which contains information about the optimizerâ€™s state, as well as the hyperparameters used.
